# Hello World!

Hi, I'm 404a10 and I'm a young programmer who likes the following things:
- Programming (Obviously)
- Solving challenges
- CyberSec
- Learning new things
- Opensource projects
- Anything related to computers
- Lists apparently

## Languages I use

I started taking programming seriously when I started learning Java, I'ts my favourite language and it's the one I'm more confortable with (I'm a little bit rusty though).

## Languages I'm currently learning

I'd also like learning ruby in the future.
